An arts community in downtown San Francisco.

The Shelton Theater, founded in 1993 by Matt Shelton, is a part of the historic Shelton Studios founded in 1961. We host and produce live performances of stand-up comedy, improv, and fine art installations. Additionally, we offer acting and improvisation classes. We provide artists with the creative respect they need and a venue at which audiences can appreciate their work. There are two intimate venues of 102 and 70 seats. Thousands of performing artists have created works in these theaters, and the Shelton family established 533 Sutter St as a cultural hub.

## Our Mission

To tell stories from a diverse community of artists to illuminate the human condition; increasing empathy, imagination, and communication.

## Who We Are

## Our Alumni

In recognition of the prospective observer’s desire to ascertain the professional quality of this institution, particularly those who are new to the film and theater communities and unfamiliar with the Shelton Theater’s reputation, we have created the following list of artist alumni. We believe many of the finest artists who have attended this institution do not appear on this list and many of their names might not be recognized. This list is by no means complete.

Alumni have won Academy Awards, Emmy Awards, Tony Awards, Obie Awards, and countless local awards.
