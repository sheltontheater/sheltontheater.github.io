Each show features veteran comedians Denise Lee, Jon Allen, and Scott Simpson. A rotating selection of experienced Bay Area and visiting comics also grace the stage.

Please arrive at the theater and check in with the box office starting an hour before the show. At the same time, the theater bar will start serving everything from craft beer to your favorite cocktails. Come early for tasty drinks and great seats!

All shows always end in plenty of time to catch the BART or MUNI.

After the last show of the night, we encourage everyone 21+ to party with us at the Shelton Theater Bar.

There is an elevator for those who need additional help with mobility.
