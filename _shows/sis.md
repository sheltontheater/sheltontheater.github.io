Secret Improv uses your suggestions to create a wide variety of scenes and songs on the spot.

Secret’s fast-paced revue earned SF Magazine’s “Best Comedy 2016” plus hundreds of 5-star online reviews. All this makes Secret Improv a perfect date spot, great for groups and a must-see attraction for locals and visitors alike. You’ll also love the Shelton’s cozy underground theater and full bar with no minimum.

After 30 years, shows often sell out, so order your tickets in advance online!

Bar opens at 7:00pm, and drinks are allowed in the theater. There is an elevator.
